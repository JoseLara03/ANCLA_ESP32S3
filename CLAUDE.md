# ANCLA_ESP32S3 — project guide

Zephyr firmware for a custom UWB **anchor** PCB: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R2 +
Qorvo DW3220 (DW3000 family), plus a MAX17048 fuel gauge and a WS2812 RGB LED.

**Start here:** `docs/handoff-2026-08-10-dw3000-port.md` — current state, build
and flash commands, and the two traps that have already cost a debug cycle each.

## Build & flash

```powershell
$env:ZEPHYR_BASE = "C:\Users\JoseAntonioLaraPerez\zephyrproject\zephyr"
west build -b ancla_esp32s3/esp32s3/procpu
west flash
west espressif monitor -p COM5
```

`$env:ZEPHYR_BASE` is **required** — this project lives outside the
`zephyrproject` west workspace. Zephyr 4.4.x, SDK at `~/zephyr-sdk-1.0.1`.

## Console

Native USB-JTAG (not UART0), prompt `uwb:~$ `.

```
anchor show                    active config as JSON
anchor id <0..3>               ranging id (default 0)
anchor mode <slave|gateway>    boot mode (default slave). GATEWAY refuses to
                               beacon unless `anchor pos` has been set.
anchor pos <x> <y> <z>         coordinates in metres; sets pos_valid
anchor ant <tx> <rx>           antenna delays (default 16385/16385)
anchor reset                   restore defaults
kernel reboot cold             apply — every setter persists immediately,
                               but changes take effect only on reboot
```

## Layout

- `boards/innovaforce/ancla_esp32s3/` — out-of-tree board definition, added to
  `BOARD_ROOT` from the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`. In-tree deliberately, so it
  is version-controlled with the firmware and immune to `west update`.
- `modules/dw3000-decadriver/` — **vendored third-party** Zephyr module
  (br101/zephyr-dw3000-decadriver @ `6208d99`, containing Qorvo dwt_uwb_driver
  08.02.02), registered via `ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES`. Carries three deliberate
  local deltas; a naive upstream re-pull will silently drop them.
- `src/main.c` — boot: load config from NVS, bring the DW3220 up, dispatch on
  mode to `uwb_slave_run()` / `uwb_gateway_run()`.
- `src/uwb_config.{c,h}` — per-anchor config (mode, id, antenna delays,
  position). Pure C, host-tested in `tests/uwb_config/`.
- `src/uwb_store.{c,h}` — the above persisted in NVS on `storage_partition`,
  via Zephyr settings, one key per field under `anchor/`.
- `src/uwb_radio.{c,h}` — DW3220 bring-up shared by both modes.
- `src/uwb_frame_802_15_4z.{c,h}` — 802.15.4z frame codec, **copied byte-for-byte**
  from `tag_testting/src/`. Keep it identical: the tag is the on-air peer, and
  divergence is a wire-format bug waiting to happen. Host-tested in
  `tests/uwb_frame/` with the tag's own suite.
- `src/uwb_dwtime.{c,h}` — the Qorvo `shared_functions` helpers the vendored
  module does not carry, plus `UUS_TO_DWT_TIME`, `FCS_LEN`, the `UUS_TO_HI32`
  macro, the TX-timestamp helper (`uwb_get_tx_timestamp_u64()`), and the
  bounded `uwb_wait_for_sysstatus_lo()` TXFRS wait.
- `src/disc_schedule.{c,h}` — per-anchor discovery response stagger. Host-tested
  in `tests/disc_schedule/`.
- `src/uwb_mac.h` — the single source of truth for the superframe constants
  (`T_SUPERFRAME_UUS`, `BEACON_OCCUPANCY_UUS`, `BEACON_GUARD_UUS`) that the
  gateway schedules the beacon from and the slaves predict it against; no
  header, no code file.
- `src/gw_core.{c,h}` — CFP seat table, leases and the tag address pool. Pure
  C, ported unchanged from the nRF5 gateway, host-tested in `tests/gw_core/`.
- `src/beacon_guard.{c,h}` — predicts the next beacon and refuses any delayed
  TX that would land on it. Pure C, host-tested in `tests/beacon_guard/`.
- `src/anchor_respond.{c,h}` — the WAVE/0xE1 and DISCOVERY/0xE4 responders.
- `src/uwb_phy.h` — the fixed PHY contract. Not runtime-configurable.
- `src/anchor_shell.c` — the `anchor` console command tree.
- `src/uwb_slave.c` — SLAVE mode: interrupt-driven SS-TWR responder, beacon
  observe, and beacon-collision TX suppression.
- `src/uwb_gateway.c` — GATEWAY mode: TDMA beacon plus the CAP seat protocol.
  MAC-only for *ranging*; it does not answer ranging polls. It does decode
  `0xEA` POS frames and hand them to `pos_sink`.
- `src/pos_sink.{c,h}` — consumes decoded tag position fixes. In E1 it logs one
  JSON line per fix; E2 replaces the body of `pos_sink_publish()` with an MQTT
  publish to `testtopic/1/position` and changes nothing else.
- `docs/dw3000-zephyr-port.md` — the port reference: local deltas, the DW3000
  call-order footgun, resolved RESET polarity, verification status.
- `docs/superpowers/{specs,plans}/` — board design spec and implementation plan.

## Hard-won facts (do not re-derive)

- **`dwt_initialise()` must be the first register access after `dwt_probe()`.**
  It is what assigns `dw->priv`; anything else first — including
  `dwt_configure()` — faults with `EXCCAUSE 28 / VADDR 0x24`. The upstream
  README's own example gets this wrong.
- **RESET (GPIO21) is `GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH`**: the NPN inverter means GPIO high =
  reset asserted. This is inverted relative to the `decawave,dw3000` binding's
  documented convention, and the board design spec's pin table originally had it
  backwards.
- **CS (GPIO10) is a GPIO, not the SPI2 hardware CSEL** — the driver holds CS low
  by hand to wake the DW3220 from DEEPSLEEP, which hardware CS cannot do.
- Pin map: SPI2 MISO 13 / MOSI 11 / SCLK 12 / CS 10; DW3220 RESET 21, WAKEUP 14,
  IRQ 42. `gpio0` = pads 0-31, `gpio1` = pads 32-53 at index `pin - 32`.
- **`dwt_configciadiag()` must be called after `dwt_configure()`**, or every
  diagnostic register reads zero — which breaks the CIR power/quality the
  DISCOVERY response carries.
- **This board reports DEV_ID `0xDECA0312`, not `0xDECA0302`.** That is the
  PDoA-capable variant id in the driver's table (`DWT_DW3000_PDOA_DEV_ID`);
  `0xDECA0302` is the base DW3000. Both probe and configure fine — do not treat
  `0312` as a wrong part.
- **The shell thread is already running before `main()`'s first statement** —
  the `uwb:~$` prompt precedes the boot banner in the log. `uwb_config_get()`'s
  lazy initialiser is unsynchronised, so it is safe only because a human cannot
  type a command inside the ~26 ms before `main()` claims the config. Anything
  that adds an earlier automatic caller (a `SYS_INIT` hook, a startup command,
  a second thread) breaks that assumption and must initialise explicitly.
- **`dwt_getframelength()` and `cb_data->datalength` include the 2-byte FCS.**
  Confirmed on hardware in the sibling project (`ESP32S3UWB@9e1087b`: flen=13 for
  an 11-byte payload). Always pass `flen - FCS_LEN` to the frame module. The
  `is_*` validators tolerate the extra bytes because they test `len >=`, but
  `uwb_frame_parse_beacon()` derives its slot count from the length — an
  unsubtracted FCS turns an 11-slot beacon into 12, with the FCS read as the
  twelfth slot. It fails silently and the output looks plausible.
- **Never poll `DWT_INT_CIADONE_BIT_MASK` after an RX event.** `dwt_isr()` clears
  `SYS_STATUS_ALL_RX_GOOD` — which includes CIADONE — *before* it calls
  `cbRxOk` (`dw3000_device.c:4764` then `:4791`). Waiting on it hangs until the
  next frame. Test `cb_data->status` instead: it is the pre-clear snapshot
  (`:4602`). The nRF5 `anchor_read_cir()` polls it and cannot be transcribed.
- **Keep `TXFRS` out of the enabled interrupt mask.** `dwt_setinterrupt(DWT_INT_RX,
  0, DWT_ENABLE_INT)` is deliberate: `anchor_respond.c`'s `tx_delayed()` polls for
  transmit completion, and enabling the TX interrupt would let the ISR clear
  TXFRS first and hang that poll — the same failure as CIADONE, on the TX side.
- **br101 runs `dwt_isr()` from the system workqueue, not the GPIO handler**
  (`platform/dw3000_hw.c:71-82`). DW3000 callbacks are therefore in thread
  context and may do SPI. That is what makes reading CIA diagnostics inside
  `cbRxOk` legal at all.
- **`UUS_TO_DWT_TIME` is 65536 here.** The nRF5 source says 63898. Both peers on
  this network — the tag and `ESP32S3UWB` — use 65536, and it scales the
  delayed-TX turnaround the two ends must agree on.
- **Anchor short address is `0x0001 + anchor_id`.** The MAC contract reserves
  `0x0000` for the gateway, so the console's 0-based id cannot go on the wire
  directly. The tag reports anchors as 1..4 while `anchor show` says 0..3; both
  are printed by `anchor show` and the boot banner.
- **The SPI bus defaults to 2 MHz and nothing switches it — you must call
  `dw3000_spi_speed_fast()` yourself.** `dw3000_spi_init()` selects
  `spi_cfgs[0]` (2 MHz); `spi_cfgs[1]` carries the DTS rate and is never
  selected unless something calls the switch. `.setfastrate` is wired into the
  driver vtable (`platform/deca_port.c:37`) but its only call sites are in a
  `static init()` wrapper that `dwt_initialise()` does not dispatch to — it
  goes to `ull_initialise` (`dw3000_device.c:9371`). The module's boot log
  prints `spi_cfgs[1].frequency`, so it reports the DTS rate whether or not
  that rate is in use: **that log line is not evidence.** `uwb_radio.c` makes
  the call after `dwt_checkidlerc()`, which is the earliest legal point — the
  part requires ≤7 MHz until it leaves INIT_RC (`deca_device_api.h:2381`,
  `:2601`).
- **The RX-side overhead was the 2 MHz bus, not the driver.** An earlier
  entry here blamed the vendored driver's ioctl-style dispatch and bit-banged
  CS for ~1700 uus between RX and `dwt_starttx()`, and concluded a 2000 uus
  turnaround was unreachable on this stack. It was reachable; the bus was
  running at a quarter of the configured rate. `read_cir()`'s
  `DW_CIA_DIAG_LOG_ALL` read is two ~108-byte bursts = 1728 bits, which is
  864 us of pure clock time at 2 MHz against ~944 us measured — the transfer
  was essentially all of it. The corollary also stands: logging was never the
  dominant cost, so do not re-litigate that either.
- **Maximum usable SPI rate here is 26.67 MHz (80/3).** The ESP32-S3 only
  produces 80 MHz/N, so the ladder is 20 / 26.67 / 40 with nothing between,
  and 40 overruns the DW3000's ~38 MHz ceiling. Request `26670000` in the DTS,
  never `26000000`: the HAL picks the highest rate **not exceeding** the
  request, so asking for 26 silently yields 20. GPIO 11/12/13 are the SPI2
  IO_MUX pins (FSPID/FSPICLK/FSPIQ), so there is no GPIO-matrix penalty at
  this rate. The module README's `spi-max-frequency = <32000000>` is the
  nRF52840 SPIM3 limit and does not transfer.
- **An unbounded wait for TXFRS can hang the whole console.**
  `tx_delayed()`'s post-`dwt_starttx()` completion poll used to spin forever
  on `DWT_INT_TXFRS_BIT_MASK`. `dwt_starttx()`'s own internal HPDWARN deadline
  check (`dw3000_device.c` `ull_starttx()`) can race a borderline-late
  delayed TX and still report `DWT_SUCCESS` for a transmission that never
  actually completes — hit this for real on the bench while testing a too-
  tight `DISC_BASE_UUS`. TXFRS then never sets, and the spin freezes the main
  thread (priority 0) permanently, killing the shell along with it. Fixed:
  `uwb_wait_for_sysstatus_lo()` (`src/uwb_dwtime.{c,h}`) now takes a
  `timeout_ms` and returns `bool`; `tx_delayed()` treats a timeout like any
  other TX failure. **The timeout bound must exceed the worst-case scheduled
  delay, not just a frame's airtime** — `dwt_starttx()` returns almost
  immediately after arming a delayed TX, the transmission itself happens only
  once the full scheduled delay elapses. An earlier attempt at this bound
  (10 ms) was shorter than `disc_resp_delay_uus(2)` and `(3)` (13 ms / 16.5 ms
  at the then-current `DISC_BASE_UUS=6000`), so it force-cancelled every
  DISCOVERY response for anchor ids ≥ 2 before they'd had a chance to fire.
  At HEAD, `DISC_BASE_UUS` is 2000 (`src/disc_schedule.h`, dropped after the
  SPI bus moved to fast rate), so the id-3 worst case is
  `disc_resp_delay_uus(3) = 2000 + 3*3500 = 12500` uus (~12.5 ms), and
  `TX_COMPLETE_TIMEOUT_MS` (`src/anchor_respond.c`) is 18 — comfortably past
  that plus airtime margin. The gateway has its own separate constant of the
  same name in `src/uwb_gateway.c` (currently 11) — the two are unrelated and
  must not be confused. See the next bullet for why 11 and not 5. Revisit
  either if the relevant delay budgets are tuned further.
- **The gateway's `TX_COMPLETE_TIMEOUT_MS` is shared by two delayed-TX call
  sites with different worst cases — size it against the larger one.**
  `tx_beacon()`'s delayed beacon and `send_grant()`'s GRANT both wait on the
  same constant after `dwt_starttx()`. An earlier value (5 ms) was derived
  only from `send_grant()`'s budget (`RX_TO_TX_DLY_UUS` ≈ 2.05 ms + airtime)
  and treated `BEACON_ARM_MARGIN_UUS` as an upper ceiling this timeout had to
  stay under. That is backwards for the beacon: the main loop only breaks out
  of RX-servicing and calls `tx_beacon()` once `to_beacon <=
  BEACON_ARM_MARGIN_UUS`, so the delayed beacon can be armed with nearly the
  full ~5.13 ms margin still to run before it fires —
  `BEACON_ARM_MARGIN_UUS` is the *lower bound* this constant must clear, not
  an upper one it must stay under. With 5 ms, every delayed beacon timed out
  on hardware (`"beacon started but TXFRS never completed"` on every beacon
  after the first, immediate one) while the CAP JOIN/GRANT path kept working
  underneath it, since JOIN/GRANT traffic doesn't depend on the beacon
  actually firing. Now 11 ms
  (`ceil(BEACON_ARM_MARGIN_UUS * 1.0256/1000) + 5`), confirmed on hardware: no
  more TXFRS timeouts, and a slave observes the beacon's `counter` field
  incrementing every superframe on the sniffer.
- **`dwt_readsystimestamphi32()` wraps every ~17.2 s.** hi32 counts 256 DTU
  ≈ 4.006 ns per tick, so 2³² ticks is 17.2 seconds. Every comparison between
  two hi32 values must be signed-difference arithmetic — `(int32_t)(a - b)` —
  which is correct for any interval under ~8.6 s. A plain unsigned compare is
  wrong across the wrap and the failure is rare, timing-dependent and looks
  like a radio fault. `beacon_guard.c` does this correctly and
  `tests/beacon_guard/` covers both directions across the boundary.
- **POS (`0xEA`) is not gated on lease state.** The gateway publishes a fix from
  any tag, including one whose seat has expired. Telemetry should not depend on
  MAC bookkeeping, and a silently dropped fix is undebuggable from the broker.
- **The gateway is MAC-only and holds two reserved values at once.** It uses
  short address `0x0000` per the contract and consumes no `anchor_id`, so the
  four ranging slaves take ids 0..3 (`0x0001`–`0x0004`). The deployment is
  therefore **five boards**, not four. Three ranging anchors would satisfy the
  tag's solver (`pos_solver.c:10` accepts n ≥ 3) but only as an exact solve
  with no averaging; the fourth makes it overdetermined.
- **Ranging confirmed on the bench via an external DWM3001CDK sniffer**, not
  the tag (its serial output is deliberately silent to keep BLE comms
  overhead low). With a real gateway + a second fw-cre SLAVE device + the
  tag, the sniffer showed this anchor (short address `0x0002`) answering both
  paths correctly: legacy WAVE/VEWA with the configured position encoded
  (`x=1.0,y=0.0` as IEEE-754 bytes `00 00 80 3F` / `00 00 00 00`), and
  DISCOVERY/RANGE-RESPONSE (`0xE2`→`0xE4`) with `src=0x0002`. This only
  confirms the RF exchange is correct, not that the tag actually resolves a
  distance from it (no visibility into that without the tag's BLE output).
  Also observed on the same air, unrelated to this anchor: the other fw-cre
  SLAVE answering DISCOVERY with `src=0x0000` — a real protocol violation
  (collides with the gateway's reserved address) on that rig, not this one;
  and a `0xE6`/`0xE7`/`0xE8` JOIN/GRANT handshake between the gateway and
  another device — spec-D TDMA provisioning traffic this project didn't
  implement at the time (see the next bullet: it does now).
- **This project's own GATEWAY mode (beacon + CAP seats) confirmed on the
  bench**, after fixing the `TX_COMPLETE_TIMEOUT_MS` regression above.
  Sniffer capture with this gateway and a tag showed periodic `0xE5` beacon
  frames (src `0x0000`) with a monotonically incrementing `counter`, and two
  tags completing JOIN→GRANT (`0xE6`→`0xE7`): `GRANT addr=0x0100 slot=0
  tier=2 lease=50` then, after the first seat's 10 s lease (`GW_LEASE_SF`=50
  superframes) expired with no observed KEEPALIVE, `GRANT addr=0x0101 slot=0
  tier=1 lease=50` reusing the freed slot. Both tags then ranged against the
  SLAVE anchors using their newly granted short addresses as source, with no
  gateway involvement in that traffic — confirming the MAC-only contract
  holds under real JOIN/GRANT load, not just in isolation. KEEPALIVE and
  RELEASE are implemented (`src/gw_core.c`) but not yet independently
  observed on the bench; lease expiry substitutes for RELEASE above.

## System context

Ranging is Two-Way Ranging (TWR); distance is computed on the tag, not the
anchor. The PHY contract every node must match — **channel 5, PLEN_1024, PAC32,
code 9, 850 kbps, SFD_IEEE_4Z, STS/PDoA off** — and the 802.15.4z wire format
live in the sibling ESP-IDF anchor project at
`../../../PlatformIO/Projects/ESP32S3UWB` (see its `CLAUDE.md`). That project is
the working reference implementation for ranging; the SLAVE responder here
(`src/anchor_respond.c`, `src/uwb_slave.c`) has now ported the WAVE and
DISCOVERY response paths from it. The gateway/beacon side is now implemented
(`src/uwb_gateway.c`, `src/gw_core.{c,h}`): a MAC-only gateway emits the
200 ms TDMA beacon and runs the CAP seat protocol (JOIN→GRANT, KEEPALIVE,
RELEASE), and slaves suppress ranging responses that would collide with that
beacon (`src/beacon_guard.{c,h}`). Beacon periodicity and JOIN→GRANT are
bench-confirmed (see "This project's own GATEWAY mode" above); KEEPALIVE and
RELEASE are implemented but not yet independently observed on the bench.
Both response paths are bench-confirmed correct over the air (sniffer capture,
see the "Ranging confirmed on the bench" hard-won fact above) after fixing the
delayed-TX turnaround budget and an unbounded-wait hang; the tag's actual
distance computation is not independently observable from this project.
